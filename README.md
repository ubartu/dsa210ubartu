DSA210 Term Project


Motivation
Understanding customer behavior and sales patterns is crucial for any retail business. In this project, I aim to analyze hourly sales data from a coffeeshop to:

Identify peak hours and slow periods to optimize staffing and inventory management.
Investigate patterns that may be influenced by time-of-day, weekdays, and external factors.
Provide actionable insights that can help improve marketing strategies and overall operational efficiency.
Strengthen my data science skills through the complete pipeline—from data collection and cleaning to analysis, visualization, and reporting.
Data Source
Primary Dataset:
The dataset consists of hourly sales records from a coffeeshop, covering the period from January 1, 2025, to April 31, 2025. This data includes transaction details such as sales amounts, timestamps, and possibly product information.

Data Collection Method:
The data was extracted from the coffeeshop’s point-of-sale system. It was provided in an Excel format which records sales intensity on an hourly basis.

Data Enrichment:
To deepen the analysis, I plan to integrate additional datasets. For instance, local weather data or records of local events can be merged with the sales data. This enriched dataset will help explore how external conditions may impact sales trends.

Data Analysis
The project will follow a comprehensive data science workflow:

Data Cleaning:

Handle missing or inconsistent data.
Standardize date and time formats.
Verify and correct any anomalies in the sales records.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Visualize hourly sales trends using line graphs and bar charts.
Analyze daily and weekly patterns.
Use heatmaps to display sales intensity across different times and days.
Statistical Analysis & Modeling:

Apply time series analysis to detect seasonal trends and patterns.
Use regression models to quantify the relationship between sales and external factors (if enriched data is available).
Explore predictive modeling (e.g., ARIMA, Random Forest) to forecast future sales.
Visualization:

Develop clear, interactive visualizations to communicate findings.
Create dashboards that highlight key performance indicators (KPIs) and trends.
Expected Findings
Peak and Off-Peak Analysis:
Identification of the busiest hours and the most sluggish periods of the day/week.

Sales Trends:
Insight into daily, weekly, and potentially seasonal variations in sales.

External Influences:
Understanding the impact of external factors (e.g., weather conditions, local events) on sales performance.

Operational Recommendations:
Practical suggestions for improving business operations, such as optimizing staffing schedules or planning promotions during peak times.

Limitations and Future Work
Limitations:

Data Duration: The dataset covers only one month, which may not capture longer-term trends.
Data Quality: Possible inaccuracies or missing values in the original dataset.
Limited External Data: Initial analysis may not fully capture external influences unless additional datasets are successfully integrated.
Future Work:

Extend the analysis to include multiple months or even yearly data for a comprehensive view.
Incorporate more external variables such as detailed weather data, local event calendars, or social media sentiment analysis.
Enhance predictive models with advanced machine learning techniques to improve forecasting accuracy.
Develop an interactive dashboard for real-time monitoring of sales trends.
Conclusion
This project is an opportunity to apply data science techniques to a real-world problem. By analyzing the coffeeshop sales data and integrating supplementary datasets, the project aims to uncover valuable insights that can drive operational improvements. The complete data science pipeline—from data cleaning to visualization—will not only provide practical recommendations for the business but also serve as a hands-on learning experience in applying data science methodologies.
